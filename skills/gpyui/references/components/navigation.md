# Navigation

Generated Python API reference for gpyui 0.4.0.

## Tabs

Native selection among labeled tabs.

### Runnable example

```python
import gpyui as ui

control = ui.Tabs(["Overview", "Activity", "Settings"], value=1)

app = ui.Application(ui.Column([control]), title="Tabs", width=640, height=340)
app.run()
```

Run this in a fresh Python process on a desktop with the native build installed.

### Properties

| Property | Default | Type / accepted values | Update |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | `[]` | list[str] | Assignment |
| `value` | `0` | nonnegative int | Assignment |
| `disabled` | `false` | bool | Assignment |

All controls support `visible` and `dispose()`. Hiding or detaching retains native state; disposal permanently releases it. See [Control](https://gtrefalt.github.io/gpyui/reference/core/).

### Events and state

- `on_change(event)`: Runs after native value and Python mirror/bound State change.

Handlers can take zero arguments or one `Event`, and can be synchronous or async. They run on the owned Python asyncio loop. See [events and asyncio](../state-and-events.md).

`bind_value(State(...))` binds both ways without echoing native edits back through setters. `unbind()` disposes the subscription. See [state binding](../state-and-events.md).

### Contract and limits

value is a zero-based item index. Compose the corresponding content in Python.

All controls accept [pixel layout and semantic theme styling](../styling.md) through `.style(...)`. Collections are copied on assignment/read: reassign them to submit updates.

## Sidebar

Native sidebar navigation.

### Runnable example

```python
import gpyui as ui

control = ui.Sidebar(["Overview", "Projects", "Settings"], value=1).style(height=160)

app = ui.Application(ui.Column([control]), title="Sidebar", width=640, height=340)
app.run()

## Pagination

A native pagination control.
