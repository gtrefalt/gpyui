# Date, time and color

Generated Python API reference for gpyui 0.5.0.

## Calendar

Retained native calendar selection.

### Runnable example

```python
import gpyui as ui

control = ui.Calendar("2026-10-02")

app = ui.Application(ui.Column([control]), title="Calendar", width=640, height=480)
app.run()
```

Run this in a fresh Python process on a desktop with the native build installed.

### Properties

| Property | Default | Type / accepted values | Update |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `""` | ISO date string | Assignment |

All controls support `visible` and `dispose()`. Hiding or detaching retains native state; disposal permanently releases it. See [Control](https://gtrefalt.github.io/gpyui/reference/core/).

### Events and state

- `on_change(event)`: Runs after native value and Python mirror/bound State change.

Handlers can take zero arguments or one `Event`, and can be synchronous or async. They run on the owned Python asyncio loop. See [events and asyncio](../state-and-events.md).

`bind_value(State(...))` binds both ways without echoing native edits back through setters. `unbind()` disposes the subscription. See [state binding](../state-and-events.md).

### Contract and limits

Single ISO date, YYYY-MM-DD, or "" for no date. Date ranges are not exposed.

All controls accept [pixel layout and semantic theme styling](../styling.md) through `.style(...)`. Collections are copied on assignment/read: reassign them to submit updates.

## DatePicker

Native single-date picker.

### Runnable example

```python
import gpyui as ui

control = ui.DatePicker("2026-10-02")

app = ui.Application(ui.Column([control]), title="DatePicker", width=640, height=340)
app.run()
```

## TimeField

Native local time editing.

### Runnable example

```python
import gpyui as ui

control = ui.TimeField("09:30:00")

app = ui.Application(ui.Column([control]), title="TimeField", width=640, height=340)
app.run()
```

Run this in a fresh Python process on a desktop with the native build installed.

### Properties

| Property | Default | Type / accepted values | Update |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `"09:30:00"` | local time string | Assignment |

All controls support `visible` and `dispose()`. Hiding or detaching retains native state; disposal permanently releases it. See [Control](https://gtrefalt.github.io/gpyui/reference/core/).

`bind_value(State(...))` binds both ways without echoing native edits back through setters. `unbind()` disposes the subscription. See [state binding](../state-and-events.md).

### Contract and limits

Local time strings normalize to HH:MM:SS. Timezone-aware values are rejected.

All controls accept [pixel layout and semantic theme styling](../styling.md) through `.style(...)`. Collections are copied on assignment/read: reassign them to submit updates.

## ColorPicker

Native RGB/RGBA color selection.

### Runnable example

```python
import gpyui as ui

control = ui.ColorPicker("#3b82f6")

app = ui.Application(ui.Column([control]), title="ColorPicker", width=640, height=340)
app.run()
```

Run this in a fresh Python process on a desktop with the native build installed.

### Properties

| Property | Default | Type / accepted values | Update |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `"#3b82f6"` | RGB/RGBA hex string | Assignment |

All controls support `visible` and `dispose()`. Hiding or detaching retains native state; disposal permanently releases it. See [Control](https://gtrefalt.github.io/gpyui/reference/core/).

### Events and state

`bind_value(State(...))` binds both ways without echoing native edits back through setters. `unbind()` disposes the subscription. See [state binding](../state-and-events.md).

### Contract and limits

Use #rrggbb or #rrggbbaa. Alpha is retained.

All controls accept [pixel layout and semantic theme styling](../styling.md) through `.style(...)`. Collections are copied on assignment/read: reassign them to submit updates.
